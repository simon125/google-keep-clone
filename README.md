# Google keep clone


### Google keep clone is a clone of well known service from google for notes/tasks and much more.

By doing it, I was trying to clone the UI almost in 100%(from. list of notes, panel for searching) without bunch of features,
Project for me is kind of challange, sandbox for new getting know new features/packages/compoennts/libraries, and playground for getting know good practices and approaches in react which I'm looking for in docs/medium/tutorials.

### Live demo

You can easyli check the current version [here](https://keep-clone-app.firebaseapp.com/)


## Tech

- React (with hooks^^)
- Redux
- Formik for validation form
- Firebase (firestore, auth)
- Styled Components
- npm, bunch of components, drag and drop library (react-beautiful-dnd)

- trello for tracking progress and keep order


## TODO

- RWD - must have
- Refactor if new side project won't consume my whole attention
